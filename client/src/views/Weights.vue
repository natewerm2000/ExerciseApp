            Sandbells are quite self explanatory, its a bag specifically filled with sand to give it weight.
            There can be some annoyances to sandbells, such as the weight distribution being uneven or even changing, due to sands natural behaviour.
            That can be an annoyance, and also a benefit to your workouts, the sudden change in weight distribution can give a surprise in your muscles
            and you might possibly need to exert more strength or even target a different muscle, Making all the workouts quite beneficial.
            For example, you can incorporate a sandbel into a lunge rotation. This is when you hold the weight in your torso with bent elbows, then you 
            step forward in a lunging motion and twist to one side. Triggering a lot of muslces in a lot of central muslcles, especially your core.
            One safety benefit is also the sandbag being just sand, it would definitely hurt less if you drop it on your toe, atleast compared to a normal freeweight.
            <p>Some great workouts are:</p>
            Woodchop, 
            Bent-over Row, 
            Skater, 
            Russian twist, and
            Hip swing.

             Kettlebells can get ridiculously heavy, anywhere to a maximum of 100 pounds! But dont let those weights intimidate you
             when you have an excellent handle on the top of the weight, making gripping a lot easier.
             Kettlebells are great for full body workouts, all you have to do is incorporate the strength of your hands to hold the kettlebell.
             Grips strength is definitely a major benefit in using kettlebells.
             <p>Some workouts include:</p>
             Goblet Squat
             One-arm row, 
             One-arm press, 
             Shoulder halo, 
             Around the leg pass, and
            Chest-loaded swing.
