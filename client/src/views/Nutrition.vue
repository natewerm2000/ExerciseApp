          Are you getting enough protein in your diet? While you may watch your calories, 
          sugar and salt intake, you should also make sure you are ingesting enough protein. 
          It plays a key role in the creation and maintenance of every cell in our bodies. It fuels our cells and powers our bodies.
          <p>why do we need protein?</p>
          1. Build. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage and skin. In fact, your hair and nails are comprised mostly of protein.

2. Repair. Your body uses it to build and repair tissue.

3. Oxygenate. Red blood cells contain a protein compound that carries oxygen throughout the body. This helps supply your entire body with the nutrients it needs.

4. Digest. About half the dietary protein that you consume each day goes into making enzymes, which aids in digesting food, and making new cells and body chemicals.

5. Regulate. Protein plays an important role in hormone regulation, especially during the transformation and development of cells during puberty.

          Eating more whole grains is an easy way to make your diet healthier. Whole grains are packed 
          with nutrients including protein, fiber, B vitamins, antioxidants, and trace minerals (iron, zinc, copper, and magnesium). A diet rich in whole grains has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and some forms of cancer. Whole-grain diets
           can also improve bowel health by helping to maintain regular bowel movements and promote growth of healthy bacteria in the colon.

          You need a small amount of fat in your diet for healthy functioning. 
          Oils and fats supply calories and essential fats and help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E
           and K. The type of fat is just as important for health as the total amount of fat consumed. That's why it's important to choose healthier unsaturated fats.
           Eating too much and the wrong kinds of fats, such as saturated and trans fats, may raise unhealthy LDL cholesterol and lower healthy HDL cholesterol.
