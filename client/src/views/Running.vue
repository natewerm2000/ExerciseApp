      <div class = "message-body">
        Generally, a long run is a base run that lasts long enough to leave the runner moderately or even severely fatigued. The main
        benefit of distance running is to gain endurance, stamina, and survive longer distances of running. Distance running is a great fat burner and all body workout for a nice slim tone. To get 
        started on distance running, start running short distances at a moderate pace, and overtime just simply increase both of those values. Mix it up a little too!
        Do some intervals of harder runs and slow down between the intervals, get that stamina up! Do some hills on your next run too! Running is quite simple, just run but dont run too hard.
        Wanna push yourself? Sure do it but know your limits. Wanna take it easy on the next run? Go right aheaad! With proper habits in nutrition and running,
        you will meet your goals very fast!

        <p>Some recommended goals to set as a beginner:</p>
          <p>Run your first mile</p>
          <p>Run your first 5k</p>
          <p>Set your time for each distance</p>
          <p>Try and break those times to show improvement</p>
          <p>Wanna take it up a notch? Try increasing your pace and distance, continue that habit until desired results are met</p>

          Sprinting is a shorted distance run that consists of reaching top speed for a small period of time. A runners top speed can only be
          maintained for a short period of time, roughly 40 seconds. Sprinting can be for both casual and professional runners. To workout for Sprinting,
          it is usually seperated into intervals, between rests or very slow jogs.
          <p>Some sprinting workouts/races are:</p>
          <p>100 meter dash</p>
          <p>200 meter dash</p>
          <p>400 meter dash</p>

        If you want to get started with running, you most certainly need a decent pair of running shoes that are designed for you.
        Make sure the shoe properly fits heel to toe, and has perfect cushioning. Consider what types of runs you are planning on doing.
        The setting/type of material you run on also determines which shoe is best, the type of runs you do determine how muchh cushion you need and the type of shoe you need.

          "The Easy Run"
          <p>Consists of a long run with no set pace, usually ran at a slow pace for roughly 45 minutes or whatever if comfortable for you.</p>
          <p>"The Tempo Run"</p>
          <p>40 minute run with 3x5 minutes at tempo pace, and a 3 minute recovery in between.</p>
          <p>"The Progression Workout"</p>
          <p>Over the course of a workout, you will increase your pace overtime and finish hard! For example, do a 40 minute run starting off at roughly
            a 11:00 minute mile pace, slowly increase that pace throughout the run and end at an 8:00 minute mile pace.
          </p>
          <p>"The Hill Workout"</p>
          <p>Short Hill sprints: 8 hill sprints with a light jog back down for rest, following a 3 mile run.</p>
          <p>"The Main Interval Workout"</p>
          <p>8 x 400 meters on the track with a light jog in between (800 meters). Keep a consistant pace in the main 400 meters lap</p>
